## TastyFoodHere Platform

TastyFoodHere is a platform that would help restaurants waiters and clients ease the process of interaction between themselves with an automated process of booking, serving, calling, and notifying. The idea is that clients will use a web application in order to see the menu, see reviews or book a table if available giving the order. After the booking, they are called by the waiter to confirm the booking. The waiters will use an Android application to see all tables that they serve, orders for each table as well as live notifications if they are called by a certain table. The platform will have more functionalities besides the mentioned ones that are mentioned in Functional/Non-Functional Requirements. The platform will be divided in 4 main components: Backend(Spring), Frontend(Angular), Mobile(Android) abd IoT(Arduino).

## Backlog and Progress

Project backlog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ianic1999/tasty-food-here-platform/projects/2">here</a>. It clearly defines the current progress of the project and the estimations for each task. Each ticket has assigned to it some labels showing storypoints, component and sprint. At the moment the project is in documentation stage.

## Future plans

In next sprints, the building of application will start. Firstly, the backend will be build. When the API is ready, Web And Mobile applications will be built and connected with the backend using REST Api. Finally we will have a ready product that will ease the process of interaction between waiters and clients.
